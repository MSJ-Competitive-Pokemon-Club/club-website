<h1> In this lesson on Status Conditions, we pit three pairs of two identical pokemon against each other.<h1>
<h1>The <b>Burn Victim</b> slowly loses health and does less <i>physical damage</i>, losing against its mirror opponent  </h1>
<h1>The <b>Paralyzed Victim</b> moves slower, so its mirror opponent attacks first and knocks it out   </h1>
<h1>The <b>Toxic Victim</b> quickly loses health and dies before its mirror opponent </h1>
