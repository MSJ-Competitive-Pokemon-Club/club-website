<h1 class="grid-item"> If your move's type is super effective against the enemy's type, it will deal double damage. If it's super effective against BOTH enemy's types, it deals 4x damage. If the move is resisted by the enemy type, it will only deal 1/2x damage. All of the 4 target Pokemon being attacked by Great Tusk are equally tanky; the difference in damage they take is solely as a result of type matchups. As you can see, type matchups are CRITICAL in winning pokemon battles. </h1>
