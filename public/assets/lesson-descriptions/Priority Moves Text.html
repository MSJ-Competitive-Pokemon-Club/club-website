<h1> Priority Moves have additional priority. Most moves have priority 0, so the pokemon with higher Speed moves first. Ice Shard has +1 Priority, so it moves before Garchomp EVEN THOUGH Garchomp has higher speed. </h1>
<h1> Mach Punch also has +1 priority, and Breloom has higher speed, so since the two moves have equivalent priority (at +1), the pokemon with higher speed (Breloom) attacks first. </h1>
