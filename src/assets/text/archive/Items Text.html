<h1> A pokemon can hold 1 item, which can be critical in determining the outcome of battle. </h1>
<h2> Hoopa is holding a Life Orb; it allows it to deal more damage, knocking out this Garchomp when it normally wouldn't, at the cost of 10% of its HP every turn. </h2>
<h2> Leftovers slowly heals the Clodsire holding it, allowing it to outlast its mirror opponent without leftovers. </h2>
<h2> Heatran holds an Air Balloon, making it immune to Ground-Type moves like Earth Power. However, when Heatran takes any damage, the balloon pops and leaves it vulnerable. </h2>
<h2> Kingambit is holding a focus sash, keeping it at 1 health when it receives a normally fatal attack at full health, allowing it to counter attack. </h2>
<h2> Pelipper holds an Eject Button, allowing it to come in, set up Rain, and switch back out automatically when hit without wasting a turn. </h2>
<h2> Dondozo holds a Lum Berry, allowing it to heal itself of any status condition like Toxic once automatically. </h2>
