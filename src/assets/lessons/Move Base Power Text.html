<h1> The two Rotom-Wash's in this battle have exactly identical stats and items. However, one Rotom-Wash uses Thunderbolt, which has only 90 base power and can't one-hit KO its enemy. The other Rotom-Wash uses Thunder, which has 110 base power. Because damage scales off of base power, Thunder one-shots its enemy when Thunderbolt wouldn't have. </h1>
